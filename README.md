# Better Armor Progression
Better Armor Progression is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod for Minecraft 1.16.4 that adds new armor sets to the game.
Most of the new armor sets contain Set Bonuses, which are unique effects that only activate if you're wearing the full set of armor.

This mod is still very much in development and is missing most textures and crafting recipes as the coding is much easier and more fun to me :)  
Don't consider this ready for public consumption until v1.0.0.

## New Sets
Roughly in order of progression. May not be fully up-to-date as mechanics are updated and balanced. Check the in-game tooltips for accurate information.
- Stone Armor

Several more sets are planned, so stay tuned...
